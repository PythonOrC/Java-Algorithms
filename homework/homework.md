# 1 - Homework 1: Falling Object

## Question:

Compute the position of a falling object and print it

- use the equation
- `position = 0.5 * g * time * time + initialVelocity * time + initialPosition`
- where `g` is the gravity constant `-9.8 m/s^2`
- `position` is in meters
- `time` is in seconds
- `initialVelocity` is in meters per second
- `initialPosition` is in meters

if `time` is 10 seconds, `initialVelocity` is 0, and `initialPosition` is 0, then the position should be `-490.0m`

```java
class FallingObject{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    /*
     * Steps to solve the problem
     *  1. Declare variables
     *  2. Assign values to variables
     *  3. Compute the position
     *  4. Print the result
     */
  }
}
```
